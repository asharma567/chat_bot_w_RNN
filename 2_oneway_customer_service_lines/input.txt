Bye:)
Let me have a look if I can help you resolve this. Slow internet is really frustrating.
I think the first thing I would like to just check is when last have you restarted the modem?
Ok, in that case let me run a system diagnostics from my end. Standby...
OK looking at your system, it seems people have been brute forcing your WPS authentication protocol. They have also gotten right.
I see in the past week 15 devices have been registered to your modem.
They all seem very active
Ok, one moment while I change some settings.
Ok, what I have done is disabled WPS. This is a very insecure protocol. What I will need from you is to log into the router and change your password also.
Are you able to do this or do you need me to guide you through the process?
Great. Ah I see only 3 devices now. Your TV, laptop and cellphone.
Would you like to test the speed?
Great, in that case. I hope you enjoy streaming series and movies:)
Hey Jeramey. This seems like a really easy problem to fix.
Looking at your records, I see you ordered the  five shelf bookcase deluxe?
Give me one moment while I verify stock and shipping details...
Great, done. Your new shelf should be arriving on Wednesday.
is there anything else I can assist you with
in that case I hope you have a great day further

Hi Peter. sorry to hear you want to leave us lets look at your account. what is the cell phone number?

but your service is currently working right?

I can upgraded you to unlimited calling 4G plan with 10 Gigs of data for $10 less per month. I believe the 4 G will sove your issues
there will be no charges associated with this change and no extension of your contract. this is just to put you on the right towers for your smartphone. I do need you to power your phone completely off then power back on to reset it.
you should see a 4G LTE symbol next to ACME when your phone reboots now

Thank you Josh. Let me just check what is going on in your account and give you the details regarding the cancelation procedures.
It seems you have still got 8 months on your iPhone contact. What we can do is waive the cancelation fee and only charge you for the remainder of the iPhone costs.

The remainder totals to $120
Standby while I process the cancelation.

Could you provide me with the cellphone number of the primary account holder?

I am sorry Peter, but that is the fee to cancel the contact. Taking into account how unhappy you are, could I convince you to stay with ACME if we provide you a 10% discount per month on your remaining bill?
Sorry Peter, but I believe that is the best I can currently do.
Great news:) Let me just authorize this discount.

ok lets look at your account. what is the cell phone number?

they should have upgraded you to a 4G plan for such a powerful smartphone.
i can upgrade you to an unlimited plan for $10 less per month and the 4G should solve the dropped call problem
ok there is no additional charges for the change and wont change you contract length at all. this should have been changed when you upgraded last month.

Hey Peter, Let me assist you with canceling your contract
Could you provide me with your cellphone number?
Thank you, stand by while I pull up your information.
OK I have the information in front of me, it seems you have 11 months remaining on this contract. Taking cancelation frees into account it will cost you roughly $650 to terminate this contract
Instead of making them reimburse you, what I can do is make a ticket saying you plan to transfer. Then when they contact us to transfer your number we will be able to streamline the process. How does that sound?
Great, let me get everything ready on our side, then when you transfer everything will be very smooth for you.
No problem. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

Hey Jeramey, I let me assist you with this.

OK I see the person which was responsible for the delivery was Bob. Let me try and contact him quickly.
Ok, I have gotten hold of Bob. He mentioned that he did initially  leave the modem in front of your door but after climbing in the car he realized he made a mistake.
He still has your package. This is our mistake. He shold have left a message.

would this work for you?

You should have your modem within the next hour or so. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
In that case I hope you have a great day further.
Bye:)
Let me have a look if I can help you resolve this. Slow internet is really frustrating.
I think the first thing I would like to just check is when last have you restarted the modem?
Ok, in that case let me run a system diagnostics from my end. Standby...
OK looking at your system, it seems people have been brute forcing your WPS authentication protocol. They have also gotten right.
I see in the past week 15 devices have been registered to your modem.
They all seem very active
Ok, one moment while I change some settings.
Ok, what I have done is disabled WPS. This is a very insecure protocol. What I will need from you is to log into the router and change your password also.
Are you able to do this or do you need me to guide you through the process?
Great. Ah I see only 3 devices now. Your TV, laptop and cellphone.
Would you like to test the speed?
Great, in that case. I hope you enjoy streaming series and movies:)
Hey Jeramey. This seems like a really easy problem to fix.
Looking at your records, I see you ordered the  five shelf bookcase deluxe?

I am sorry Peter, but that is the fee to cancel the contact. Taking into account how unhappy you are, could I convince you to stay with ACME if we provide you a 10% discount per month on your remaining bill?
Sorry Peter, but I believe that is the best I can currently do.
Great news:) Let me just authorize this discount.
OK it has been done. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Was a pleasure helping you, have a great day.
ok lets see what i can do. what is the phone number on the account so i can try and track the package?
ok i show it was delivered by UPS but they didnt get a signature so that is their fault
i am going to file a claim and send a new one out via FEDEX
ok it should arrive by 5 pm tomorrow
ok lets look up your account and see if i can track your package>? what is the phone number on the account?
ok i pulled up your account. it appears it is beign delivered by UPSPS. they have until 8 pm to deliver and it is currently 4:45pm
yes it may be still out with a carrier they mark it delivered when carrier takes it out post office
no problem if it doesnt arrive by 8pm please call me back direct we are open until 11pm at 888 555 1212 ext 567 and i will escalate the claim
ok lets look at your account. what is the cell phone number?
i see you just upgraded to an iphone 6 and are on a 900 minute per month 3G plan
they should have upgraded you to a 4G plan for such a powerful smartphone.
i can upgrade you to an unlimited plan for $10 less per month and the 4G should solve the dropped call problem
ok there is no additional charges for the change and wont change you contract length at all. this should have been changed when you upgraded last month.
just power your phone completely off and back on to reset and you shoudl see the change right away with the 4G LTE symbol next to ACME on your iphone
great anything else i can help you with today?
thank you for being a loyal acme customer
ok lets look up you account and see whats happening

no it is UPS fault there is no charge to you
ok so i opened a claim and new modem will be delivered by 5pm tomorrow via fedex
Hey Peter, Let me assist you with canceling your contract
Could you provide me with your cellphone number?
Thank you, stand by while I pull up your information.
OK I have the information in front of me, it seems you have 11 months remaining on this contract. Taking cancelation frees into account it will cost you roughly $650 to terminate this contract
Instead of making them reimburse you, what I can do is make a ticket saying you plan to transfer. Then when they contact us to transfer your number we will be able to streamline the process. How does that sound?
Great, let me get everything ready on our side, then when you transfer everything will be very smooth for you.
No problem. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Have a great day.
